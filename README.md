## About the project

This page was made for the "Weather App" challenge on TheOdinProject.com.

The page was meant to showcase the API and webpack skills learned so far, it's fully responsive and was built using HTML-CSS for styling and Javascript for some dynamic features and API calls.

It relies on WeatherAPI to show the user the climate (and other weather data) of a given city.

You can test the demo [here.](https://jgoldenusr.github.io/6.Weather-App/)
